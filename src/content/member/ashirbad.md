#### Namaste, Ashirbad here 🙏
I am a normie Linux user, that's why I'm here. While I'm currently doing my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I also enjoy tinkering with programming. I love FOSS and its contribution to our lives. 

Beyond the linux thing, I'm fascinated by semiconductors, the building blocks of modern electronics, consumer electronics and the entire manufacturing process. I also enjoy learning about economics and social development.
