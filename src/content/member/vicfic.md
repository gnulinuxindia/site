### Nillionare, Thinker, Gamer. 

I'm a Linux enthusiast and an aspiring competitive programmer. After bash, C++ & Python are my go to languages, and know a bit of Java too. I have a soft corner for Gamedev and use the Godot engine heavily. I like to automate away mundane tasks, especially working on bash/js scripts to scrape some site with Captcha. I'm also interested in covert communication methods (steganography) mostly making use of unicode shenanigans.

Apart from computers, I'm a professional cyclist, and I've studied Carnatic vocals & violin for a couple of years (though I wouldn't say I've mastered it) and know how to play the Interstellar theme song on piano. Ambitious, and I'm open to working on such FOSS projects.

arch btw.
