üéâ Announcing the "Shell Script Showcase May" Challenge! üéâ

Welcome to the first ever monthly contest for Gnu Linux India group.

### What is it all about?
We are looking for the most innovative and unconventional shell scripts out there. Whether you're a seasoned shell scripting guru or just dipping your toes into the terminal, this challenge is for you! Create scripts that dazzle, scripts that surprise, and scripts that push the boundaries of what's possible in the command line.

### What can you do?
The possibilities are endless! You could whip up scripts that generate ASCII art from images, craft personalized chatbots that chat up a storm, or even conjure up mini-games that provide hours of terminal-based fun. Let your imagination run wild and show us what you've got!

### How does it work?
1. Create your unique shell script during the month of May.
2. Share your masterpiece with the community before 25th May.
3. We will host a video call where everyone can show off their scripts.
3. The community will vote for their favorites via polls.
4. The script with the most votes wins!

### Rules
1. Only POSIX-like shells are allowed, more explicitly only
   - Bash
   - Zsh
   - Fish
   - Dash

### What's at stake?
As if the glory of winning weren't enough, the ultimate champion will receive a shiny **300 rupee Amazon gift card** as a token of our appreciation for their shell scripting prowess.

So, dust off your keyboard, fire up your terminal, and get ready to amaze us with your shell scripting skills! Let's make this "Shell Script Showcase May" one for the history books!

Happy scripting! üöÄüêö
